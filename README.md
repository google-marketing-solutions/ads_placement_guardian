# CPR - Channel Placement Excluder (Cloud)

# Problem Statement
There are a number of “spam/bot” and poor performing channels on YouTube, causing customers to spends large amounts of money on YouTube video campaigns on channels that do not drive results.

Clients need a solution that can quickly and automatically keep on top of poor performing channels or potential “spam/bot” channels and exclude them from their entire account on a regular basis.

# Solution
A Google Cloud based soution for excluding YouTube channels at an account level, based on a set of criteria defined by the client. A client can select a set of filters within their Google Ads data (such as low conversions, high CPMs or no traffic etc.) and then apply a set of YouTube filters against channel statistic (such as subscriber count, video views, langage etc.) and exclude specific channels that do not meet the performance requirements.

The tool will display all the merged data, exclusions available and can be scheduled to automatically run the process on a regular basis to keep up with any new channels or campaigns that fall outside of the required performance.
